# DRDO Scientist Records Dashboard

This project is a secure web-based dashboard designed to manage and retrieve the complete internal records of scientists working at DRDO. The system allows administrators to access an individual’s full profile — from basic identification details to the most granular data relevant to their role — simply by entering the scientist's name or employee number.
